This site is designed for high school students, undergraduates, graduate students, and early career professionals who are interested in working as public historians in small to medium-sized history museums, art museums, historical societies, and archives in Massachusetts. 

### About Me

I am a public history master's student at Northeastern University, passionate about the study of early American material culture, decorative arts, public history, and digital humanities.  I have interned at several museums and historic sites, gaining skills in curation, collections care, exhibit development, and museum education.
